# COMP3710

The following repository shows my COMP3710 A1. 
I have shows 3 iterations of what is called the pathogorean tree. 
1. With static color and symetry (angle= pi/4) 
2. With dynamic coloring using the depth of the dynamic tree and symetry 
3. With dynamic coloring and changing the angle from pi/4 to pi/3 for the left 
branch and pi/6 for the right branch

The remainder of the demo can be found in the following google colab notebook:
